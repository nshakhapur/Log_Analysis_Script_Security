# 📊 Log Analysis Tool

Welcome to the **Log Analysis Tool**, a Python-based solution for analyzing server logs. This tool is designed to extract meaningful insights from your log files, detect suspicious activity, and provide professional-quality visualizations to support decision-making. It is built with **Python**, incorporating **data science techniques** and **cybersecurity principles**.

---

## 🚀 Features

1. **Request Count by IP Address**:
   - Identify the most active IPs making requests to the server.
   - Provides sorted results in descending order.

2. **Most Accessed Endpoints**:
   - Analyze which endpoints (e.g., `/home`, `/login`) are most frequently accessed.
   - Useful for understanding user behavior or potential attack targets.

3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**:
   - Detect brute-force login attempts using failed login patterns (`401` or "Invalid credentials").
   - Flag IPs exceeding a configurable threshold of failed logins (default: 10).

4. **Data Visualizations**:
   - Heatmaps, bar plots, and histograms to intuitively represent the data.
   - Professional-quality plots created with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

5. **CSV Reporting**:
   - Save results to a structured CSV file with three sections:
     - Requests per IP.
     - Most accessed endpoints.
     - Suspicious IPs and their failed login counts.

## 📚 How to Use
### Step 1: Prepare Your Log File

Place your log file (e.g., sample.log) in the same directory as the script.
### Step 2: Run the Script

Execute the log_analysis.py script:

python log_analysis.py

### Step 3: Explore the Results

    View insights in the terminal:
        Requests per IP.
        Most accessed endpoints.
        Suspicious activity detection.
    View visualizations automatically generated by the script.
    Access a CSV file (log_analysis_results.csv) for further analysis or reporting.

## 📈 Outputs and Visualizations
### 1. Requests per IP

Terminal output example:

IP Address           Request Count
192.168.1.1          234
203.0.113.5          187
10.0.0.2             92

### 2. Most Accessed Endpoint

/home (Accessed 403 times)

### 3. Suspicious Activity

IP Address           Failed Login Attempts
192.168.1.100        56
203.0.113.34         12

### 4. Visualizations

    Heatmap: Shows request intensity by IP.
    Histogram: Displays the distribution of endpoint access counts.
    Bar Chart: Highlights suspicious IPs with failed login attempts.

## ⚙️ Configuration

    Threshold for suspicious activity detection: Default is 10 failed logins but can be modified in the script.
    Log file format: Ensure your log file follows standard server logging conventions.
